## Ways to Help

There are many ways you as an individual can help, and to help we've broken it down to four main areas.

- Suggest Icons - Search and open issues for suggestions you don't find.
- Contribute Icons - Hundreds of open ideas waiting to be created.
- Develop - Help make this website better.
- Documentation - Icons exist everywhere let's make it easy on everyone to use them.

Step by step guides below outline the above ways to contribute.

### Suggest Icons

The easiest way to help is to suggest icons, all you need is a GitHub account.

Simply visit the [issues](https://github.com/Pictogrammers/MaterialDesign/issues) section of our repository and click "New issue", a template will guide you through the information we're looking for. Images can be pasted in comments to provide examples.

The team will take a look at your issue as soon as possible and label it accordingly. We may ask you for more information on what exactly you want or even reject your suggestion entirely if we feel it's too specific, but don't let that put you off suggesting more icons in the future!

A member of the team or another designer should eventually reply with a designed icon, then we will review it and hopefully add it to the set.

### Contribute Icons

You may want to contribute an icon that you made yourself, that's great! Just create an [issue](https://github.com/Pictogrammers/MaterialDesign/issues) on GitHub and we'll take a look. Make sure you follow the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) so you will have to make little to no revisions and hopefully it'll get added to the set!

If you need ideas for what to design you can always take a look at the currently open issues and reply with your design.

It's surprising how many different ways an icon can be conveyed. While the guidelines give good structure, having a diverse set of choices allows for continuous refinement on new and existing icons. If you want to you can open an issue with a refined design or even lowered point count.

All icons you create will be assigned to you if they are accepted by the core team.

### Develop

This [site](/contribute/site) is open source, from the documentation to the front end. Pull Requests are usually merged within a day (especially documentation related PRs);

All content is mostly stored in Markdown files and can be edited right from GitHub's editor.

The [API endpoints](/contribute/site/api) are still being documented and are being worked on to provide more robust functionality.

### Documentation
