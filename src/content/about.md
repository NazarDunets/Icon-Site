# About

Oldest commit was June 2014, but the planning for MDI started a few months prior and has slowly grown over the years.

## Material Design Icons

Shortly after releasing MDI Google released an official set of icons which has made the project much easier to maintain and has grown.

## Material Design Icons Light

While MDI works great for many uses they can often look blocky when scaled to a larger size.

## Maintainer

Austin Andrews started the project and generally ensures the community stays happy. The Pictogrammers Icon Group
maintains all icon libraries and first-party add-ons and extensions.
